Best for home use
Nice product.
"reduced 2 starts because sometimes the print colour is not the colour we want especially ivory and all.
too much ink usage when printing black pics like a blackboard on pic and paper is kinda hard to insert, Other ways the printer is satisfied for emergency use.
note : i didn't try scanner yet"
Black cartridge emptied after printing 23 pages
"We have purchased many things from AMAZON. No defects or problem Hence there is no option to say dislike
Technical support does not arise"
"It is seems like good, once you bought you will face ink consumable and ink cost will be compensated within 5 month, Ho ink cost -850(around), just image of theses things, and if you consider 3rd party ink, that will spoil your printer, Most importantly last April '22 I bought, This March it got mind issue it is not working properly, think before buy, inkjet printers"
All over the printer is good for home use except the ink cartridge but you can watch the tutorials on YOUTUBE........how to fill ink cartridge....
"Qualitywise the plastic body used is fragile (like you get a feel that it might break). Although they have provided a paper for instructions with images on how to set it up - it's very difficult for a new person to understand and then install it. A video link might help or you need to search on youtube. Print quality wise also - it's not the best, but not worst also - it's 4.8/5. I feel it's a bit overpriced as well.

I connected to my Windows 10 laptop, it asked me to download HP software from Microsoft Windows Store and a few next-next-next things, setup was quick. You just sign-in with your email address registered to HP.

It's a 5/5 product but will give 4 because I feel it's a bit overpriced and paper might also get jammed sometimes.

Edit (31/01/2023) : The printer sometimes disconnects after 1 print and the pc/laptop stops detecting the printer."
Product is ok..it's only for home uses and small official works.delivery very good.print quality ok
Its printing really slow when i feed a document to print even in black and white
Easy to install and print

"It is bad choice
No value of money"
Very good product for normal use.
Very basic AIO printer.

Superb
