Vijay Anand,Reviewed in India on 9 May 2023,"1. Ive had inkjet printers in the past but this one is extremely noisy. It feels like it is cracking its knuckles, and breaking its own bones to transform into a werewolf when it warms up.

2. I don't know if it is just my unit, but this printer goes berserk 7 out of 10 times when i turn it on where all the lights just blink non stop and it wont do anything else. And i cant for the life of me figure out what the issue is.

Bottomline : there are loads of better printers out there, without all the drama. Im trying to find a way to contacy support to see how to troubleshoot the blinky lights scenario. So far no luck."

Overall very satisfied with the product ."
Sanjeev,Reviewed in India on 27 January 2023,"Bought it off Amazon as got a better deal.
Pros - HP name and product quality. WiFi direct. Wifi printing (2.4 Ghz only). Setup is easy and straightforward.
Cons - They claim 6000 pages for color and black Lets see how much it lasts. Even if it lasts 3000 pages it will be worth it.The paper tray is behind the printer output tray and not below it as is the case with most AIO printers. Wifi works only on 2.4 Ghz network. Surprised that only 802.11 b/g/n is supported. 802.11 a/c is not supported which has 5 Ghz bands. Display is quite tiny and black and white. Though it doesnt affect functionality, it looks dated. At this cost, some do offer an ADF (Even lower priced non-ink tank printers offer ADF) and auto duplex printing, which isnt available with the smart tank 585."
