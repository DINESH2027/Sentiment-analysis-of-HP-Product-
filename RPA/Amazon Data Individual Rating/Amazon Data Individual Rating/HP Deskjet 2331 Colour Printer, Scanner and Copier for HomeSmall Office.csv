Anand Girdhar,Reviewed in India on 22 May 2023,"To Buying a Printer we check brand, features, quality & warrenty in this Hp Deskjet printer initial cost of this printer is low as compare to operating cost. I purchase this printer for 2,499/- in Diwali Offer but cartridge price is very high when I want to change it is approximately 2500 for black and for colors. After making some jugaad's I try to refill there cartridges with watching some youtube videos. But lead to loss of printer head and leakeage of inks into printer. I personally recommend to buy inkjet or laserjet printer for better experience and long run for this initial cost is high but in future operating cost will be low.

CAUTION: hp ink catridges are infamous for ink level reuction from 100% to 20% just after printing 5 color picture in glossy paper

Randhir Kumar Mishra,Reviewed in India on 7 May 2023,"1) In every 2 to 3 months you need to change cartridge
2) refill the cartridge repeatedly
3) while refilling colour spread in your hands on table
4) Youtuber says caterer issue will be resolve but that's not fact.
5) you can't connect ink tank in this printer.
6) colour print is not appropriate according to the HP shows in the advertisement"

Nikhil M.,Reviewed in India on 29 December 2022,"Qualitywise the plastic body used is fragile (like you get a feel that it might break). Although they have provided a paper for instructions with images on how to set it up - it's very difficult for a new person to understand and then install it. A video link might help or you need to search on youtube. Print quality wise also - it's not the best, but not worst also - it's 4.8/5. I feel it's a bit overpriced as well.

I connected to my Windows 10 laptop, it asked me to download HP software from Microsoft Windows Store and a few next-next-next things, setup was quick. You just sign-in with your email address registered to HP.

It's a 5/5 product but will give 4 because I feel it's a bit overpriced and paper might also get jammed sometimes.

Edit (31/01/2023) : The printer sometimes disconnects after 1 print and the pc/laptop stops detecting the printer."

For less than rs.4k and refills costing around 600-700 for black and white and 700-800 for colour cartridges I feel it is one good inkjet printer with basic functions.

PD,Reviewed in India on 30 December 2020,"I have used HP printer in past but that was long time ago and now this is my 2nd HP printer. Overall the product is good at this price tag, but I am sure some improvements can be done to enhance user experience. Fit and finish of product is good and is light weight.
1) Installation software needs to be downloaded from HP website and installation is smooth. Software is not very user friendly though
2) I faced issue with my 1st print as after installation of software it was just not printing. But later is started printing after a reboot and about 15 mins
3) Print quality is ok and bit slow, as we expect from a Deskjet printer. (Please don't compare print quality with Laser printer)
4) Scanning is good, scans perfectly but its slow (specially with high DPI). I faced one issue with the software wrt scanning. I can save a PDF with multiple pages in 200 DPI but it does not work with 600 DPI. Maybe HP can provide a resolution or improve the software
5) Last but not the least, Ink cartridges. I am sure these small cartridges with the printer won't even last 100 pages. Most of my printing is black, but even a black one will not last 100 pages. So buying new cartridges at 600-800 per piece is a rip off. Better deal with refilling to have economical printing

Overall its a good product."
Rajendra Mule,Reviewed in India on 17 August 2020,"It's been about a month that I'm using the printer and have printed about 140 pages. My reviews are based on the usage in this short period. Hope this helps.

Use: Printer is good for normal home use.

Pages/cartridge: With the cartridges supplied, one can print just about 40 pages (not 100 as mentioned/advertised).

Cost of printing: If cartridges are replaced each time, the cost of printing is too high (something like 19/- per page for b/w). Simply refilling the ink is far economical.

Printing quality: On printing quality, it's better than average. As mentioned, good for home use. Print in draft mode. For pages <= 70 GSM, printing back-back is not advisable. It's traces are visible on the rear page as well.

Printing speed: It prints slightly slow, this being an ink-jet. That's fine and expected.

Features: Prints, Scans and Copies. This is kind-of basic model, so no features such as automatic double-side printing. That's known and is fine. It goes well when more than one page is placed in the feeder. With a single page, it needs to be inserted in the slot till the end below, which isn't easy...and the page usually get's stuck while printing. It's advised in the manual to use multiple pages in the feeder (manual is not a part of the product...to be searched/downloaded online).

Handle with care: Parts are delicate, need to handle with care (especially while removing cartridges to refill).

Overall: At this price, it's good to have."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in India on 11 May 2023,"The printer is so slow. HP has promised it will print 400 pages, it printed hardly 40 pages and the cartridge is gone. I got the new one for Rs. 1500/-, the cartridge promised for 120 pages for both color and black-white, but it hardly printed 40 pages and it has stopped working. Can't believe HP will be doing this promise and fail to deliver the product to their said expectations."
s,Reviewed in India on 31 July 2022,"I ordered this machine to copy, print, and scan to save images on my PC. I wanted to help my 89-year mother during my three-week stay in India. Copy& print? no problem! Scanning the document and saving the to PC using HP smart? It was a nightmare! I could not get a single HP tech support person on the phone/Whatsapp /online chat to help. The directions on the brochure were ridiculous. I needed to turn in important financial documents before the deadline and I could not. I called USA HP support and begged them to help me figure it out. Though the agent was sympathetic, he refused to intervene claiming it was 'HP India's responsibility. I was in tears. I couldn't help my poor mother who is living in a small town and c was counting on me to sort things out for her.
I just don't understand why to sell a product that you can't support esp. for a global conglomerate such as HP. Just disappointed!"

Vicky K,Reviewed in India on 18 August 2021,"This printer is amazing. It does high-quality scans, copies documents significantly faster than some of the older devices, and the print quality is impressive.

But.

The cartridge runs out before you even know it. I understand that this is a problem not only with HP printers but most of the printers available in the market, but, HP to follow the same razor and blade module is so not okay.

The cartridge runs out extremely fast, and you have to change it before you have even got a chance to play with your prints. The cartridges are around Rs. 800 each, so I don't think if you print regularly, this is the right one for you. But if you are like me, who only uses the printer for home purposes, then yeah, go for it. This printer is amazing and does what you need it to do.

All in all, the decision is up to you. The cartridge runs out fast, but the printer is super convenient, and the prints it gives are of high quality.

Cheerio,

Deep shikha,Reviewed in India on 29 October 2021,"I bought it this year in Jan, and I am regretting it...so I am writing a review to stop others from making the same mistake. Don't get fooled by other reviews or 3 star rating, you are just paying for a plastic box that's it! If you are lucky and it is printing then guess what it will print only 10-15 pages with the official HP ink cartridge. So if you take a print from a shop you will have a much better quality and still save your money! The worst part is customer support, the numbers mentioned on documents and the box in which it came, DO NOT EXISTS anymore! I tried getting the customer care from the vendors, even they are not able to reach HP customer support. Their website is designed to help all other customer then printers...it is complicated to find service details other than software tutorials for printer...there are limited authorized service center in Delhi for printer and guess what where there are...on the edges of the Delhi...you have to carry this whole damn box all the way to NCR. I am an IT guy I usually fix printer issues on my own like connectivity , driver missing etc...but this printer is evil at it's core! All the ink levels are full, latest drivers are installed and still it will print a blank page every damn time! Why? How? And which machine takes hours to WAKE UP! I literally have to wait for hours before it gets ready to print a single damn page.

Manoj Krishnan,Reviewed in India on 4 February 2018,"
HP DeskJet 2131 All-in-One Printer is a simple and reasonably priced product of HP. It is a good choice for personal use if you don't need bulk printing.

Here are my observations:

1. The product was shipped to me on time without any hassle and follow-ups.

2. The packaging was impressive, and on unboxing, it did not give me a shock. The product was brand new, without any damage.

3. Its assembling is little tedious. I would advise you to go through the youtube videos and the manual carefully before start assembling.

4. As my laptop does not have a CD driver, I downloaded the printer driver from the internet. I checked printing of a color page and it worked perfectly.

5. But the cartridges are small, and it consumes a lot of ink, so printing would be damn costly for those whose intend to use it for bulk printing.

6. I liked the white color of this printer. It gives an elegant look.

7. Another nice feature of this printer is its all in one [printing, scanning, and photocopy] facility. It makes it a good choice.

8. The product is not robust. You can realize it while assembling the printer, so if you plan to purchase it, make sure you will have to handle it carefully.

9. There is no wi-fi support, and it is a big limitation with this product.

Overall verdict: Reasonably priced and a good printer for use at home."

Always Indian,Reviewed in India on 21 April 2021,"If you know how to remove a few pieces of sticky tape and follow pictorial illustrations to slot in the ink cartridges, the initial setup is easy. What is not so easy is getting HP's Smart App to work. It's an utterly senseless interface with ambiguous prompts and instructions. Once you have figured out that you don't need to 'add' the already installed printer, then you run into a regularly freezing app. Thank goodness for Ctrl-Alt-Del. HP offers no advice or good solutions for their Smart App's freezing problem. There is a workaround though, which I finally discovered after trying umpteen number of things. Terrible terrible 'Not-Smart' app. Print quality is OK. Scan quality is poor."
Sweet KP,Reviewed in India on 12 December 2022,Printer is ok but it's not good for black and color ink because of cartridge is small and one cartridge to get a print to 100 paper only so it's hurting some budget people's because of cartridge price is 800 so buying any printer that time check all details and buy your best product
fatheen,Reviewed in India on 9 May 2020,"Printer is ok for those who are economically well to face heavy maintenance cost. I could print only 80 pages (b/w) with the provided cartridge. I realised that it is not meant for me, so i returned it immediately.

Pros
1. Comparatively cheap cost printer with AIO features
2. Good printing speed with medium quality for home purpose
3. Quality scanning and functioning

Cons
1. Heavy maintenance cost (especially for cartridges, you have to pay about Rs. 769/- per cartridge)
2. Colour fades after few days
3. Colour print is not up to the mark
4. Ink refilling is an option but risky (lasts maximum 3 times per cartridge)

Suggestion
1. Better go for ink tank printers, even though initial cost is more - profitable in long run (if you print atleast 300 pages per month, then compulsorily go for ink tank)
2. Take care in case you plan to refill the ink, it may damage your printer as well as void your warranty"

sai reddy,Reviewed in India on 23 March 2022,Printer is very good for home use. It is light and is easy to set up and operate. ONLY DRAWBACK IS THE COST OF COMPATIBLE CARTRIDGE HP 803 which is very expensive. A combo of black and multicolor HP 803 cartridges will cost you around *1500/- (for 2 cartridges) which is more than half of the cost of this printer. Hence i didn't give 5 star rating.
Feri,Reviewed in India on 18 August 2021,"Print quality is satisfactory, as this was for casual home use. Setup is easy as only the cartridges provided need to be installed. Need the HP Smart App on laptop for using the printer. The printer is recognized immediately on connection. The app shows how much of the cartridge colour/black is left. Taken about 15 black and white prints and the cartridge capacity has come to 50%. That was expected from the setup cartridge provided and hence one star less as more life would be better, hope new cartridge lasts more. I would recommend this for casual home use. Direct printing from phone would need an OTG dongle on phone and the HP Printer Service app from Playstore."

Which is very expensive one cartridges is about 800 rs both will cost 1600 rs. It means you have to purchase both cartridge of 1600 rs only after print of 30-40 pages only. Please buy ink tank printer not this.

Now both of color and black catrige doesnt recognizing.

New Catridges cost 1900 around. That is insane amount compared to printer cost.
Hp suggests always replace catridges after single use(40 photo printing-1900rupees).they wont even listen or attempt to repair if there is other faults otherthan catridge unless u buy new catridges of 1900.

Then why the hell will someone buy this costly catridge rather not throwing the machine in first place.we do not have money thats why we came to this cheap price.

You may try inktankbut again that is also fitted with so many chip components and i doubt hp set some type of firmware there too,but laserjet is defimately best option for a cost effective and long run printer.
so at the end i am going with CANON LB2900 as it is long lasting and made from Japan.
Previously i have a canon inkjet ip1300 .that has been working for 10years .trust me.
So Canon is a good choice.hp may have more service centers than canon,but what if u cant get the service out of that.
Nothing is more than costomer satisfaction.

So u may try canon inkjets.but i personally recommend always go for canon specially laser printers."

Ashok kr,Reviewed in India on 30 January 2018,"First of all, hats off to amazon for delivering the printer 5 days before the expected date. So, no complaints about that.

About printer, it looks stylish. It is very compact. Looks great in white color. This is my first printer and I bought it for home use. It serves the purpose very well. The installation is very easy. It works like charm. The hp software is very idiotic. It says connect the printer, even after taking prints from Microsoft Word, scanning from the 'Devices and Printers' options in control panel. It worked means the pc recognizes it, but the idiotic hp software doesn't recognize it. But you can always get your job done from control panel, so I don't care about it now. The controls are very intuitive. So, go for it if your main purpose is for home use.

I wish I could end up here, but unfortunately NO! It uses HP 803 cartridge. And it is too expensive being tri-color at 949/- and black at 799/- !! The page yield for tri-color is ~165 pages and for black it is ~190 pages. It will empty your pockets like nothing!
I'm thinking to refill the cartridge instead of buying a new one.

So, final verdict. If you are ready to spend this much amount of money on cartridges, then surely go for it. Otherwise, go for 2135 Ink Advantage. I wish I would be known about this at the time of buying. 5 stars for printer and 3 stars for cartridge."
JOHN KIRAN,Reviewed in India on 25 November 2021,"*You can't get a good size print as it automatically crops the bottom part of your page while printing an A4 size sheet.
*Ink cartridge gets depleated very fast and costs 800rs each (needs to be changed once a month)
*Always requires a connection to the HP smart app, which does not function if either colour or black cartridge gets low.
*I reccomend to buy a more expensive printer, as the experience will be better and you can save money on ink."

Anish Samant,Reviewed in India on 15 June 2017,"Just saw that many people are thinking to buy this product as it's price is really low. But if u are buying this for everyday usage, its a sincere advice from me to not go for this printer as the cartridge is very expensive and also dries up very soon. The black one costs around ₹800 and colour is around ₹1000. Refiling the cartridge is not a solution as u lose it printer warranty and also print quality is horrible. If u are buying a printer for everyday usage, it's better to go for ""INK ADVANTAGE PRINTER"" from HP or else Ink Tank printers are best option as u can directly put the ink in them and it is very cheap.
But talking about the print quality, it is a good printer when used with genuine HP cartridge and u can also use it for photo prints. But u cannot print both sides at once and u need to manually rotate the paper in order to do so
That's all about the printer...hit the helpful button if u are satisfied with my review..."

Manav beniwal,Reviewed in India on 28 March 2022,"I bought this product exactly 3 months back on 27th December and been using it since then. I had refill the cartridges thrice already even though I hadn't even print 300 pages till now. It is written that the cartridge can be refilled but in reality the printer don't accept refilled cartridges be it black or colour. First printer and it's worst home printer.
I had tried contacting customer support but what they say is just buy new cartridge.
It's cheating to say that each cartridge can print 200 pages but I had already refilled 3 times and haven't even printed more than 300 pages yet. And now it's not accepting a refilled cartridge . DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. It's a review after the product has been used for 3 months.
Edit- It had been 6+ months while I'm using this printer. Do not buy this printer, to be precise I got a fresh cartridge of both colour and black ink, printed only 61 black and white prints and only 3 color prints, black ink cartridge is empty and color is half empty, last color cartridge also finished with just 4 color prints.
Can't refill, can't keep spending money on useless cartridges.

Yes there is a jugaad to this that is you can refill cartridge all you need is suction tool and an injunction to inject ink to cartridge then you are good to go it will be cheap and affordable only downside is you should reay to get your hands inky .
Ankur Gome,Reviewed in India on 4 May 2017,"The product came in very good condition , courier services was great,
The printer is awsome didnt need any software to install to my window 8.1 pc it was plug and play.
The print quility is very good
Printer is silent
Color prints are good
It took almost 12-13 seconds per print b/w
And 20 seconds for color ( depends on the image )
scan quality is awsome super detailed when done on 600 dpi
xerox is also of good quality but i think it has a shorter scan while photo copy because i did few and noticed that the bottom of the page got cut out
Few buyers would say that the print cost is high but thats only true when you buy new cartridge every single time when it gets run out of ink, instead you could buy a set of ink of prodot under 350 rupee you will get 1 b/w 100ml and 3 tri color ink 100 ml each.
you can fill b/w ink cartridge upto 20 times by that means every single page would cost you only 1.5 to 2 rupee
And thats cheap
Otherwise its a nice budget printer for personal usage"

Caution: If you live in a dusty room or anywhere there's dusty environment that impacts printer, these small printers are dust sensitive and can be damaged easily(especially the scanner bed) with ample amount of dust, so to protect, either buy a printer cover(the plastic one) or create a 2 layer DIY polythene printer cover by yourself this will ensure no dust enters any vent of the printer and maximize its life and keep the surroundings of printer clean so that it stays safe and gives you consistent good quality prints and scans."
Nilin Dutta,Reviewed in India on 13 July 2020,"Things I want you to know:
1.It is not cost effective for long term.

Reason: The cartridges which they give (1 Black and white, 1 Tri-Colour) are not at all sufficient. At max, you will get 50 best quality printouts or 70 Draft/Normal printouts .

2. You need to buy extra cartridges which will print around 190 pages and will cost Rs.755/- per cartridge. Just keep this point in your mind.
3. In my case, the same day, the printer arrived, after printing 5 pages, all the lights started blinking and I had to lock a complaint call to HP. The technician came after 2 days , applied white grease , dealt with the cartridge placements and repaired the (new) printer!
4. You must take the extended warranty for at least 2years, coz you shouldnt rely solely on the guaranteed product.
5. The print quality will vary according to cartridges. But I must say, go for the wifi enabled printers [which it isnt]."
Loy Neil,Reviewed in India on 18 July 2020,"The printer is working perfectly fine and the quality of the print is really awesome the only drawback of this printer is the cost of the cartridge. The combo of HP 803 costs around Rs 1500 which is half the price of the printer itself. Moreover, the cartridge does not last long for 100 pages the maximum pages which can be printed with a single cartridge is 20 pages.

I would recommend not to buy this product unless and until you wanna spend your hard-earned money lavishly."

- Easy refill of cartridge
- Easy installing new cartridge

Disadvantage:
- Bad if not used regularly
- Inks dries if not used for long time
- Need to replace cartridge if not used for long time

If you are planning for Printer at home so you can buy this product.

B.Dilip Chandra,Reviewed in India on 13 November 2018,"I got this one primarily for scanning the old photos and save them in PC. It does it's job. Nothing to complain about scanner. About the printing, good for few prints but really this is not a heavy duty printer. For serious printing and printing too many papers, go for some higher version or a laser jet. This printer is just for scanning and printing few papers and not for heavy use.
Print quality: good but not for heavy use
Scan: Good and it does it's job.
Durability: not that good for heavy printing, good for scanning. Body of the maching is not that heavy and not that sturdy.

user-friendly, medium-sized not too big or too small. good for desk and personal use.
2 ink cartridges come with the printer. it's a light lavender coloured printer which I love. there's no printing paper with it.
HOW TO INSTALL:-
so I am writing this because I myself had never used a printer in my life on my own.
1. remove the covers and plastics and the cardboard inside protecting the ink slots. adjust the paper alignment (the paper alignment bar can be moved to adjust) and close the inner door from where the print will come out, only open the outer door.
2. connect the wires to your laptop/desktop and go to the website provided in the pamphlet.
3. follow the instructions from the website and you're done!!

Joyjit,Reviewed in India on 23 March 2021,"Printer setup and configuration is pretty easy. The cartridge life is really poor. For me it exhausted after printing about 40 to 45 pages. Both the black and the colour cartridges exhausted. Other than that, if the paper gets jammed, you have to be really careful to take it out from the printer because it may damage the interior ribbons. Print quality is really good at this range and photocopy is also good."

Col S S Passi,Reviewed in India on 30 April 2021,It seems the black ink cartridge was already dried up .Few prints were taken and the impressions were very light and then it stopped altogether.Now I am getting my print work done from market.The colour cartridge dose not print black & white work at all.There is some problem. I did have two copies printed of my vaccination certificate with colour where in PM’s photo was in colour.No technical staff ever responded my call. The printer is lying like a monument.If approved I would like to return it and buy some other model or else cartridges be replaced and also technical assistance provided to ascertain serviceability of the printer.

Kazi Uzma,Reviewed in India on 12 May 2020,"It is a good printer.. I would say the best

But its only good if you print for like 15-20 pages a month .. (mostly for home use)

I ordered this for my study room..

So I print for like 15 pages a month ..

If u r using it at home or will consume it less then this is the right product..

If u are looking for an office use or you will use it everyday then this product is not for you...
I would recommend you to go for other options

But for few prints (home use) its the best product

Easy to use / install / clean etc..

I loved it .. it worked for me

Lookwise 👍
Printing quality 👍
Colour print 👍

This is very good printer and print quality is awsome but its printing price is too high so if you thinks that you can easily refill cartrige forgot about it is rejected by printer once you refill using suction tool and other etc you have no choice you have to buy new cartidge which price 1600 for both ... because after refilling printer reject the cartidge and you cannt use it again ...it is completely use less ..

My advice is to buy a inkjet tank printer which can esaily refill..
still i m using it is not for heavy duty it is for less work i m student so its good for printing front pages of my assignments ..!
It will print 70 colour pages and 160 black and white pages .. esaily loving it .."
Naval Patel,Reviewed in India on 19 October 2015,"Staples delivered the HP2131 DeskJet printer actually a day earlier than scheduled, and in excellent condition. The product itself is thoroughly satisfactory. However the Installation instructions sent with it were perfunctory in the extreme, and merely pictorial. I had to guess the sequence of several operations, and be helped by a relative with experience of a similar device, in order to get the printer operative. The ""Instruction Book"" sent with the item is similarly next to useless. For example it does not instruct how to adjust features of the machine such as brightness, contrast, colour temperatures; it does not instruct how to deal with usual malfunctions such as paper jams and power failures; it does not even instruct how to invoke the scanning feature.
Overall, appears a good buy for users already literate in methods of using HP machines."

Nishant,Reviewed in India on 14 July 2020,"This printer is a very cool deal in this price point. You can print , scan and copy easily. I personally liked this product. It is best suitable for home use. However printing rate is a little slow but it produces high quality prints.
Based on my observations, I can say that -
1) Printing speed - 7/10
2) Print quality - 10/10
3) Command (how fast it catches the commands) - 9.5/10
4) Durability - 9/10
5) Scanning - 10/10
6) Functioning of buttons placed on the printer - 10/10

One more thing that I can see on this printer that it will not catch the paper on the tray if only one is placed. You have to manually press that single paper so only your printer will recognize it.
Otherwise everything is good."

VinodhKumar Anbalagan,Reviewed in India on 16 November 2019,"The printer is working good.
We bought it in diwali offer. For this much lesser price , the printer is working very very nice. The quality is so good. Thanks to Amazon and HP. I bought it for my dad while I use another HP LaserJet p1007 printer. Both the printers r working well.
Initially I had little problem in installing this deskjet printer to iball 8"" tablet PC. The printer model/ type was not showing initially. But the problem is rectified now. Still I have to find the way to ""scan"" the printer in the tablet pc even after installing the HP smart app. I don' have much time.
Still I have yet to try the cloud printing or it would be better if HP helps to make work the scanning function. The other 2 functions (print and copy) r working fine.

2) Ultra basic.
3) The cartridges last for about 60 to 70 each with medium usage.
4) No mobile connectivity.

Please try going for the ink advantage version of this model which costs between 5500 to 6500. But the best deal would be to save some money and go for the epson ecotank."

I've to call the customer care and after hours of spending time with them there wasn't any luck. Later I updated the OS of my system and I was able to get the printer going. I hardly printed 20 papers before the quality started to degrade. On checking the ink level, it was sufficient to print a single page in greyscale mode. However, the printer is not able to output one single page properly. The customer care representative is quick to point out that I need to purchase new cartridge. When I told them to send a technician at my home as this is under warranty, they simply refused. Way to go HP, keep it up and you'll lose enough customers."

I wont blame to Amazon, Amazon always remain the best in the delivery its about the HP wholesaler didn't provided the correct information. Amazon as a feedback please add a tag on this product that cartridge is non- refillable. I never faced any issue in whole span in 6 to 8 years in shopping with Amazon still i would say its best.

4. Copy (Photostat) functionality is good. Can copy both in color and black&white.
5. Scan functionality is also good. Once the necessary drivers are installed as part of the installation and printer is added to laptop/desktop, one will understand how to use the scan functionality."

Now I found the reason why hp is buying this good printer for low price, if you want to print pictures this is just a scam. If you want to print a pictures it prints just 4-5 page & cost of cartridge is 1200 so cost per page is 300 rupees, when I bought this printer & printed 4 pictures on A4 size pages and my ink got over I thought you I don't used cartridge and I ordered for new one & after installing new one I printed again A4 size picture & checked cartridge it because half.
HP don't even allow us to refill if we refill our cartridge then our printer will not have warranty so if you are only black and white printer then buy then one but for colour printing don't buy this better go to cyber cafe and print what you want or buy laser printer never ever buy inkjet printers for colour printing."

Palash,Reviewed in India on 9 November 2020,"Pros
-Print quality is really great.
-Print speed is fast compared to its previous models.
-Installation is very easy.
-Works with OTG cable in Android
-Lightweight
-Good Build quality

Cons
-Works with OTG cable in Android (However you cannot adjust the print size or quality. It just prints a single image on full size page)
-The software immediately displays the ink levels as half empty even if you just printed a single page.
-Ink is too damn costly.

If you have an occasional use of coloured printing, go for it. It's the best in price range. But for regular use it'll put a whole in your pocket."

Yeah, the cartridge proves to be very uneconomical; So better if you refill the catridge at the right time( when the ink level is low but not dried up )... I suggest you to get a prodot ink bottle and you can easily fill upto 20 times..

It is being used frequently by all of us in our family."

Neha,Reviewed in India on 25 August 2019,"The cartridge is too costly to maintain. Once the ink is finished, we can't refill the cartridge with the ink. Even if we try to fill the cartridge with the ink, the pages turn out to be blank or void of the respective color. Hence, the cartridge has to be replaced again, which makes it very costly to maintain."

Ashish Jha,Reviewed in India on 31 December 2021,"I usually don't write negative reviews, because I don't like to spread negativity. But I absolutely had to write this review to let people know NEVER to buy this piece of junk, even by mistake.

It prints exactly 4 - 5 pages with every refill, and that's it!

Yes, its that pathetic...

1 printer refill = Rs. 800. So essentially, you're paying Rs. 800 for 5 pages of print.

HP should be ashamed for selling this piece of crap in the open market.

NEVER buy this piece of crap, even if someone gives it to you for free."

Because it contains HP 803 catridge which costs Rs.827 in amazon as on today i.e. 28-07-2017 and the rate is increasing day by day. And this catridge will give you 65 to 75 pages in normal print mode. And this printer and its software will not be allowing you to refill the catridge. other brand low price catridges will also be not accepted by the printer. You must buy original 803 catridge of HP. Don't think that you can do something with youtube videos and will use the printer by refilling catridge or something. The software is unbreakable. Even if you refill, the software automatically stops printing after 100 pages or so, even though it contains enough ink. This is best suitable for corporate companies but not for normal home purpose."

so it's really costly right? you can easily get print from outside in 2/3 rs per copy max to max.
So my final suggestion would be if you are looking for your printing requirement and you think that it would cast less from outside, then you are wrong, for scanning you can go for it."

athul chandran,Reviewed in India on 9 June 2022,"So the printer is pretty decent, for its price. Or so it seems. After about 30-40 prints, it starts showing error saying ink is about to run out. I tried the refill ink, which wasnt accepted. So basically, we may end up buying the catridge every month or so, which is too expensive and end up way more costlier than the printer itself. Nice little scam, team hp !!"

Then I checked the product of scanning procedure
It's very very slow and the colour printout has no perfect quality

Mahir haneef,Reviewed in India on 28 December 2020,"Have been using the printer for about a month. It's very good for home use. I'm sticking to original ink cartridges for the time being as the refill procedure provided in the after-market cartridge and ink seemed too cheap and prone to spillage. Even otherwise, original cartridges are easy to use and affordable for home use, when you consider the trouble of going to a shop to get printouts and the cost you pay there."

If you shop online original cartridge, it costs ₹800 and more ( for small black catridge that yields just ~190 pages ). That's more costly if you are taking more print out or copy. If you take less pages and do scan, then this is good for you."

Amazon Customer,Reviewed in India on 21 July 2021,Product is good but the ink cartridge price is more then the printer :)
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in India on 12 May 2021,"It is simply impossible to understand as to why HP cannot create a simple installation system. You have to first download an app which then refuses to recognise the printer and keeps asking to ""connect"" the printer when it is already connected! In three days after delivery, I have somehow managed to install the printer on two laptops and still waiting for HP app to work on one more laptop. All in all, utterly third grade product. I had canon printer earlier which was fast easier to install and operate. Not surprisingly, HP has named its printer driver as ""HP Smart"" - it is the dumbest app around"
Pranesh,Reviewed in India on 15 October 2017,"Works fine on ubuntu linux after installing the HPLIP toolbox (search in software center). I use simple scan which comes default with OS.
The cartridges run out quicky though, i did not open both color and black cartridges, only installed black one. It will print around 80 pages if prints have only words in it, around 20-30 pages if it has many images and background colors. Use once in 2-3 weeks, print a test page, to keep the ink wet.

Print quality is good, no smudges, no fades. There is another budget printer model available worth checking out - Canon Pixma MG2577s, which could save a few hundred bucks at current price."

One can search for installation process on YouTube and then follow the procedure. Print quality is too good. The best feature is that it's 3 in one printer which can print, scan and copy. The thing I didn't liked much about it is cartilage which may dry up so you need to use the printer in every 2-3 days. All the cartilage can finish after printing 100 pages. It's good for those who use it for personal home use."

Anand Rajmal,Reviewed in India on 11 April 2019,"I purchased this product in 2017 during Amazon sale. This printer is very easy to use and very friendly but cartridge is the biggest issue. With the company provided catrdige, you would be able to hardly print 15 to 20 sheets. If you do not use the printer even for 2-3 days, the ink will dry and you will have to replace the cartridge.

Each catridge would cost approx 1000 and you would be able to print max 90 pages and each page print would approximately cost you 11 Rupees, which is very bad.

I sold this in OLX for 1.5k and brought a ink based printer from Epson for 6.5K. This printer prints 6000 sheets for a catridge worth 500. The cost of each color print would be approximately 18 Paise.

Think well before you buy this printer."

6. Scanner is also not working correctly, gives error popup while scanning."

Akshit Jain,Reviewed in India on 28 February 2018,"The product is very attractive within the price range, although the printing cost is not very economic and the print is of mediocre quality, the product runs all the features of the all in one very effectively. The cartridges are a bit more expensive than the 703 pair. Very easy to install and manage though, the product is light built and of plastic body as per usual HP standards but is quite durable.

Received the package within 2 days after ordering, Thanks to amazon,
my advise would be to check with a wholesale market for the price before buying or wait till the price drops"

The printer costs a little over Rs3200 whereas the cartridges cost over Rs1700. Considering that a set of cartridges produce hardly 100-110 quality prints (HP claims 1000 pages, but I never got), this printer is not cost-effective overall."

After printing 80 pages you have to replace the ink cartridge which will cost 1000 rs. Truly sad that I have gifted this product to my cousin and feeling shame now.

Although it's price is 3500-3700 but it will cost you 8000-9000 in future.
After printing only 50-60 page the cartridge will be empty and you will have to buy new one as it is not refillable.
Cost of new cartridge is between 650-800.
So after every few days you will require new cartridge.
And there is only one cartridge of color (not three for the three colors).
So atlast after changing cartridge once you will regret your decision."

Prashant Somani,Reviewed in India on 28 April 2018,"Who ever sees its price, find it so cheap to buy immediately but beware...

This aio printer comes with demo cartridge which hardly prints your 50 pages.

Now usually people go for refilling. On each refill it prints at most 100 pages either color or bw. So you will get refill cost of ₹0.50/page for bw and ₹1.0/page for color. But now there is as a trick, this refill idea will not stay long. After 2-3 refill your cartridges stop functioning and there you go... Now new cartridge costs you ₹800 each. So not advisable for higher print counts.

Now it's not even advisable for lower print counts because you have to print one page a week to avoid ink drying.

Better go for CISS printer"

Rishabh agarwal,Reviewed in India on 12 January 2021,"This product is a scam because it’s ink consumption is very high and demands constant change in cartridge and this results in excess expense. I have used this printer for hardly 2 weeks and I have changed the ink cartridge twice already (max 20-25 pages printed)

Please don’t get tempered towards the product because of its brand and cheaper price. I hope my reviews helps both the seller and the buyer in their respective ways!!

P.S - I look for the seller to contact me and compensate for this fault product."
Amazon_Customer,Reviewed in India on 12 November 2019,"The product is great for scanning. However, the printing cost of printing is too high. It is recommended to use the color print only for emergency purposes. Roughly it could print 30-35 pages with a new 803 cartridge costing Rs.800. Buy this only if you want to use it occasionally (once in 2 months) or scanning is your primary purpose for buying it."
Jyotirmoy kashyap,Reviewed in India on 8 June 2021,"Got the printer on 30th May, hardly printed 10 color copies & on 8th June got notified the printer is low on cartridges. It's not a fare deal at all.
My replacement been done with immidiate effect. But this time 2 things apeared which were beyond expectation. The same cetridge problem & the diglouge as on the photo. System not there in the machine?? No option to call for an assitence in Amazon too.
Not happy. Asking for a refund this time."

Deepak,Reviewed in India on 3 March 2020,"Using this printer from one month without problem. Quality is good when printed with normal mode. Have not used draft or high quality mode yet.

Printed 12 colour pages and more than 50 black and white till now. Can't comment about the cartridge life.

Color print speed is much slower than black and white print, but it's ok for me because I don't need many colour prints.

Overall a good budget printer."

I need to contact HP for service and support, I do not have much time for the run around with the service center, tried calling the service center they are not picking the call. I don't know if I am calling the right number. The rating is purely for the product."

Deb,Reviewed in India on 26 September 2020,Bought hp deskjet printer a month back. Recently i am unable to take black and white print. Contacted hp service online & then informed my print problem to HP service executive. In turn they advised me to contact local service centre of hp for replacement. Surprisingly HP service centre denied any replacement of cartridge as it’s setup cartridge. HP seller has not informed that printer will be delivered with setup cartridge (limited print capability) and we have to by normal cartridge additionally. It’s unethical & not expected from hp

SUVODIP MUKHERJEE,Reviewed in India on 27 June 2021,Absolutely worthless product. Within 15 days the product started malfunctioning. Worst part is the ink. It runs maximum 100 pages in a single cartridge. Paper jam is another problem. Nothing is good about this printer. Why even #Hp manufactures such product which wear outs within a week or two. It is not even worth 1000/- rupees. It is absolute junk piece in the name of printer.

Fragile to handle.The back-end support is not stable.It takes the precision of a surgeon to main the paper in the exact position so as to be picked up my the roller to print. Print speed is too slow. If you want to print 50 pages or so , dedicate half day of yours for that. Waste of time and money. Returning it in the first 3 hours."

Pranav,Reviewed in India on 28 August 2020,"It's low cost printer but maintenance (running cost) is too high. Printing cost is approx Rs. 8-10 per page for Black and white and Rs. 10-12 for color printing because cartridge will cost you Rs. 700 (B&W) and 850 for color.
Or, If you are thinking you will refill your cartridge then you can't, because HP Smart app will deduct that cartridge and you can't print with that you have to purchase new cartridge after printing 50-60 Pages.
Hope It will Help you to select right printer for your need."
K G Kutty,Reviewed in India on 31 January 2021,"I was using an HP 1515 all-in-one printer for several years but it got stuck with a paper jam problem. It did not have any setup cartridges, but this 2331 printer is having them. Instead of simplifying setup, HP is making it more and more complicated. Since the setup cartridges are to be thrown out after a 5-minute use, they only serve the purpose of eco-unfriendliness. I can manage with this 2331 because I am running a one-man business."

I scanned few images. It's pretty inferior in quality. I literally screamed when I saw the ghastly images. Printers works for now. Will update in future."

itsmi,Reviewed in India on 31 July 2020,"I now understand why it’s priced so low. The description sells you quality but starting from installation, the paper tray and it’s alignment to the quality of print - it’s as cheap as the price. I would recommend future buyers, to at least see the quality of print, before you buy this product. After comparing the print from a cannon printer, I feel a bit short changed."

...,Reviewed in India on 28 September 2018,"Changing my review from good to bad. Because in just 7 months the printer started showing problems . Claiming warranty takes forever which FYI means a customer support executive to just hear your complain with nothing done in real.. The ink leaks . Printer throws out blank papers even after and keeps on automatically restarting. It doesn't even recognize new cartridge. Pathetic printer. DO NOT BUY IT IF ITS FOR DAILY USE. BECAUSE ONCE IT STOPS WORKING IT IS GOING TO SPOIL YOUR DAY, EVERYDAY"

ricky,Reviewed in India on 18 July 2020,In clear words DO NOT BUY this printer because of cartridge you need to refill it after after every around 30 pages print and after refilling twice you have to chnage the cartridge. Regretting after 6 months. Go for laser printer. Because in long term you will see laser will be cost effective than inkjet.

Brijesh Kumar Chaudhari,Reviewed in India on 19 June 2018,50 TO 60 PAGES ONLY PER REFILL CAN BE PRINTED. BULK PRINT REQUIRES REGULAR REFILL OF INK LIKE EVERY 60 PAGES YOU HAVE TO REFILL THE INK. BUYING A NEW CARTRIDGE WILL COST YOU 800 FOR BLACK ONE SO YOU JUST CANT BUY A NEW CARTRIDGE AGAIN AND AGAIN. PHOTOCOPIER AND SCANNER WORK FINE. CAPACITY OF INK IS TOO LESS IN THE CARTRIDGE MAKING YOU REGULARLY REFILL IT. OVERALL I DIDNT LIKE IT. CANT RETURN SO STUCK WITH IT.
